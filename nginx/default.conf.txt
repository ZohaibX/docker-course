we are actually building image of client , server , worker in the same place, WORKDIR /app
so all the files will be accessed like /index.html /app.js

and when we send some request from client to backend 
specifically for this project, we do it as /api/route-name like /api/tasks
but when all the images are in same place of docker 
they will be called only with their route-name like /tasks (as app.get("/tasks" , (req , res) => {}))
it depends on us if we mix /api in the route-name itself and route-name itself will be like /api/tasks 


in this default.conf 
we have a react on 3000
and backend on 5000 

we make them in a single port 80 
then every route that comes with "/" only -- will go to client folder -- like /index.html 

then we have # Socket connections for react app

and every route that comes with "/api" will go to backend 
          and as we can only access routes with only route-names and without /api
          so we will cut /api from the route and then will send to backend then .
          ^/api/(.*) so /$1=(.*)
